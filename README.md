### ColorClassifier
The Color classifier contains the following classes that enable classifying colors:
* ColorClassifier: Accepts a color object and returns a ColorClassification object. This allows classifying a color into one of the following 11 color groups, based on human perception of color: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown, Pink, Gray, White, Black.
* ColorNameParser: Accepts a color name and returns a Color object.
